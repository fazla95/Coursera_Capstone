Since then it has been successfully running and It has opened its many branchs\naround Europe. As its brand name has a value even outside of the europe, Now it wants to open \nits new branch in Canada. Initially it has two options that are Toronto \ncity or North York. But picking the most suitable city for opening its first branch in Canada \nis actually challenging one. There are many factors to be identified and analyzed around both \ncities and then the decision should be taken. Therefore this study helps it for finding its ideal\nplace to open its first branch in Canada."
